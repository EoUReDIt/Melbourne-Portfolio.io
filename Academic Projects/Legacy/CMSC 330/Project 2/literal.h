// This file contains the definition of the Literal class, whose representation consists of the value
// of the literal. Because both of its functions are one line functions, they are implemented as inline 
// functions. The constructor saves the value of the literal. Because this class is a subclass of Operand
// which in turn is a subclass of Expression, it must implement the function evaluate, which returns the
// value that corresponds to the literal.

//this file was updated from the original

//The function now reads a double value instead of an int.
//It uses std::istreamâ€™s ability to automatically convert strings to double values, whether the input is an integer (e.g., 5) or a floating-point number (e.g., 3.14).
//This modification allows both integers and floating-point numbers as literals.
