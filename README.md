Personal Portifolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Iâ€™m a undergraduate at University of Maryland Global Campus.
I am also an Aspiring Software Engineer.

## About Me
- I have experience in cloud computing and low-code platforms. I have 5 remaining classes to my graduation. 
- Unfortunately, I need to take two classes per semester, so I will graduate in December 2025.
- I will share programming code created in my courses as well as personal projects that I pick up to improve my skills.
